This is a package holding core files specific to MVC based leaf frameworks like Leaf MVC and Leaf API. MVC core holds functionality like shortcut functions and helpers which can be used throughout your application.

## Installation

You can easily install MVC Core using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/mvc-core
```

## Including in earlier versions

You can include mvc core in earlier versions of Leaf MVC and Leaf API manually simply by removing the already existing `Config/functions.php` and `Config/bootstrap.php` files. That's it.
